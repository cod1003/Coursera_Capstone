Boston is also a central hub for various higher education institutions, including Boston University, Emerson College, Northeastern University, Suffolk University, and UMass Boston, as well as multiple community colleges. While these institutions are dispersed across the city, students, recent graduates, and other young professionals who live in Boston live in a wide range of neighborhoods. Living in newly developed neighborhoods such as the Seaport District in South Boston expose young adults to a different mixture of venues compared to West Roxbury, one of the furthest boroughs from Downtown Boston.\n\nCountry Roads Brewery, based in Western Massachusetts, is looking to expand its operations into a location in Boston. CRB has emerged as one of the highest-rated breweries in New England for its eclectic mixture of beers, and its flagship location in South Deerfield has attracted customers from many states. It also holds a great reputation with young adults after holding promotions at restaurants near college towns like Amherst. The owners of CRB have a great knowledge of the cities and towns in Western Massachusetts, but are unfamiliar with Boston\u2019s boroughs outside of the downtown area. As a result, they hired DeBarcelos Contractors to help them determine an ideal location for their second brewery. The owners prefer a neighborhood that lacks breweries, but is close to a university and residential area that houses students and young professionals. While this project will help Country Roads Brewery, DeBarcelos Contractors hopes that the project will attract future clients, such as other emerging or trending restaurants, to strategically determine locations that fit their customer demographics. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data and Methodology"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This project will use the Foursquare API to explore location and venue data within the boroughs and neighborhoods of Boston, MA, and make a generalized observation of venues of the area. Via the API, I will make requests from the College and University endpoint to get university location data, and the Nightlife Spot endpoint to determine what bars are most prominent in each area. Through these sources, I will scrape, extract, and clean the necessary data for this project, and will further analyze the neighborhoods via k-means clustering.
