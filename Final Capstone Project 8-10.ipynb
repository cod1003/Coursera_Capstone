    "Boston, Massachusetts is one of the most populous cities in the United States of America, containing nearly 700,000 residents across 26 official neighborhoods. Boston is also a central hub for various higher education institutions, including Boston University, Emerson College, Northeastern University, Suffolk University, and UMass Boston, as well as multiple community colleges. While these institutions are dispersed across the city, students, recent graduates, and other young professionals who live in Boston live in a wide range of neighborhoods. Living in newly developed neighborhoods such as the Seaport District in South Boston expose young adults to a different mixture of venues compared to West Roxbury, one of the furthest boroughs from Downtown Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "Country Roads Brewery, based in Western Massachusetts, is looking to expand its operations into a location in Boston. CRB has emerged as one of the highest-rated breweries in New England for its eclectic mixture of beers, and its flagship location in South Deerfield has attracted customers from many states. It also holds a great reputation with young adults after holding promotions at restaurants near college towns like Amherst. The owners of CRB have a great knowledge of the cities and towns in Western Massachusetts, but are unfamiliar with Boston’s neighborhoods outside of the downtown area. As a result, they hired DeBarcelos Contractors to help them determine an ideal location for their second brewery. The owners prefer a neighborhood that lacks breweries, but is close to a university area that attracts students with residential housing and student centers. While this project will help Country Roads Brewery, DeBarcelos Contractors hopes that the project will attract future clients, such as other emerging or trending restaurants, to strategically determine locations that fit their customer demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we ask the following question: <b>When controlling for university proximity and proximity to other breweries, what neighborhood would be most ideal for Country Roads Brewery to open a location in Boston?</b>"

    "* the number of university venues and their proxminity in each neighborhood (such as classrooms, residential halls, and student centers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The neighborhood data will be officially obtained via the <a href=\"https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhoods\">City of Boston's Analytics Team </a>in order to define the 26 neighborhoods in Boston, and their coordinates will be obtained using **Google Maps API geocoding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the project will use the **Foursquare API** to explore and visualize location and venue data within the neighborhoods of Boston, using the following endpoints:\n",
    "* the **College and University endpoint**, which will help identify higher education location data and the various venue categories these institutions hold; and  \n",

    "## Results and Discussion <a name=\"results\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our analysis, we discovered there are a lot of higher education venues across Boston, in a wide swath of neighborhoods. That gave us the flexibility to go outside of the immediate downtown area, knowing that there were colleges and universities in some of the smaller neighborhoods. Conversely, there were less brewery venues than anticipated in Boston. This was surprising to our client because of the wide variation of breweries across New England and their inaccurate assumption that they were entering a crowded brewery market in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was no surprise that the neighborhoods with the highest frequency of higher education venues were in the most popular neighborhoods in the city, which have access to public transit, restaurants, historical places and various tourist attractions. Brewery locations were varied across the city, regardless of popularity. Clustering neighborhoods with both of these factors helped weed out neighborhoods that would not be ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering out neighborhoods was easier than expected - nearly half of the Boston neighborhoods were not included in these new clusters because they lacked brewery categories and/or higher education venue categories. We would not find it ideal to place Country Roads Brewing in a neighborhood that does not have many higher education venues that may posit student interaction. A caveat of this approach is that it may weed out neighborhoods that may simply not have ***any brewery*** but had plenty of higher education venues. This brought us to our final cluster groups, which were easily identifiable. The elimination of each cluster group was based on frequency of breweries, as well as lack of venue frequency that promote student interaction, such as student centers. The final two clusters - Back Bay and Chinatown - were known as having the most higher education venues, with Back Bay having the edge of having more venues with additional student interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, DeBarcelos Contractors will select **Back Bay** as the ideal neighborhood to locate the new facility for Country Roads Brewery, due to the lack of brewery venues in the area despite its large student population from neighboring colleges such as Berklee College of Music and the Boston Conservatory. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to see how the results would differ if we focused on ***all nightlife venues*** and not just brewery-like venues. What implications would be there? Would the ideal location be in a neighborhood that lacks nightlife overall? Would the neighborhood already have multiple breweries? Back Bay is rich in other restaurants and may have some nightlife as well, and it could be possible it may have not been selected as the final venue if our analysis was approached differently. "

    "## Conclusion <a name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to identify an ideal location for Country Roads Brewery to open in Boston, when controlling for university proximity and proximity to other breweries. Through the Foursquare API, we were able to identify various higher education venues, as well as brewery-like facilities across Boston's 26 neighborhoods, and established k-clustering mechanisms to explore common threads across the neighborhoods. By merging one-hot encoded groups for higher education institutions and breweries, we were able to identify neighborhoods that were more likely to have a student presence, as well as those that may have a potential brewery following. We wanted to select an ideal location that the brewery industry hasn't fulfilled yet, but would attract that young adult crowd that made Country Roads Brewery so popular in Western Massachusetts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are comfortable with selecting **Back Bay** as the ideal neighborhood to place Country Roads Brewery's new location, as they fulfill our criteria of abundant higher education venues, as well as a brewery market that has not been fulfilled in this neighborhood. We hope that this excercise inspires other breweries and restaurants to reach out to us so we can continue strategizing potential markets for them."
